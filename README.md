# ☁️ Aws Solutions
A reference repository for **architecture and solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: exported diagrams, cloud design patterns, **databases**, **best practices**, and complementary material added over time.
It started as a **diagram** collection (regional views, security, and services); the goal is to **grow** into short guides, design notes, checklists, and other resources useful for teams building on AWS—without replacing the official AWS documentation.

## 🚀 How to use this repo
1. **Pick a topic** from the table below or the [browse-by-topic](#browse-by-topic) index.
2. **Open the folder README** — each one explains what the diagram shows, the data flow, and design notes.
3. **Use the image** (`diagram.jpg` or named export) in reviews, onboarding, or design docs; link back to the folder when you share it.

This repo documents **architecture intent**, not deployment code. For implementation details, use the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) and your team’s IaC standards.

## 🧭 Browse by topic
| Topic | Diagrams | What you’ll find |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **🌐 Ingress & APIs** | [`gateway/`](./gateway/), [`complete-infrastructure/`](./complete-infrastructure/) | Public API path (domain → API Gateway → ALB → ECS), full regional stack with ALB, WAF, path routing, containers. |
| **🛡️ Security & compliance** | [`complete-infra-with-services-security/`](./complete-infra-with-services-security/) | Layered controls (Shield, GuardDuty, WAF, Inspector, Macie, Config, Security Hub) and service ↔ control mapping. |
| **🗄️ Data & private access** | [`ec2-bastion-and-private-rds/`](./ec2-bastion-and-private-rds/) | Private RDS, app on EC2/Docker, bastion + **SSH** tunnel for developers. |

## 📚 Current contents
### 🗺️ Diagrams
Each topic lives in **its own folder** with a **README** (what the drawing shows, link to the image, and any tables or notes). Images are typically JPG, PNG, or SVG depending on the tool.

| Folder | Diagram | README |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| 🏗️ [`complete-infrastructure/`](./complete-infrastructure/) | [`infrastructure-aws.jpg`](./complete-infrastructure/infrastructure-aws.jpg) | [README](./complete-infrastructure/README.md) — ALB, WAF, ECS/Docker, ECR, path-based routing (`/api`, `/api/v2`), CloudWatch, CloudTrail, S3 logging. |
| 🛡️ [`complete-infra-with-services-security/`](./complete-infra-with-services-security/) | [`infrastructure-security-aws.jpg`](./complete-infra-with-services-security/infrastructure-security-aws.jpg) | [README](./complete-infra-with-services-security/README.md) — layered security (Shield, GuardDuty, WAF, Inspector, Macie, Config, Security Hub, etc.) and a **service ↔ control** matrix. |
| 🖥️ [`ec2-bastion-and-private-rds/`](./ec2-bastion-and-private-rds/) | [`diagram.jpg`](./ec2-bastion-and-private-rds/diagram.jpg) | [README](./ec2-bastion-and-private-rds/README.md) — private **RDS**, **EC2 + Docker** application tier, **EC2 bastion**, developer access via **SSH** (`-L` local port forwarding). |
| 🌐 [`gateway/`](./gateway/) | [`diagram.jpg`](./gateway/diagram.jpg) | [README](./gateway/README.md) — **custom domain** → **API Gateway** → **ALB** → **Docker** on **ECS** (and optional **EC2** targets). |

## 📌 Planned additions
- **☁️ Cloud solutions on AWS:** high availability patterns, multi-account setups, networking, observability, cost awareness.
- **🗄️ Databases:** RDS vs. serverless choices, DynamoDB, backups, migrations, and architecture-oriented summaries.
- **📋 Best practices:** security, operations, naming, tagging, checklist-style reviews.
- **📊 More diagrams** using the same folder-per-topic and README convention.

💡 Today the main focus remains **diagrams and documentation beside them**; deployment code and IaC are not required for this repository—only what helps architectural clarity.

## 📐 Suggested conventions
- **📁 One folder per diagram (or family):** keep the image, a `README.md`, and any variants together—same pattern as the folders above.
- **🏷️ Clear names:** include context (environment, region, or purpose) and, when useful, `simple` / `complete` or a version in the filename, for example `prod-multi-az-v2.jpg`.
- **🖼️ Format:** JPG or PNG for exports; SVG when your tool supports it and you want lossless scaling.
- **🌳 As the repo grows:** optional subfolders by domain (`network/`, `data/`, `observability/`, `best-practices/`, etc.).

📝 Update this root README when you add a new top-level folder, or link straight to files from the repository tree.

## 🛠️ Common tools
Diagrams are often built with [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/), [draw.io / diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/), Lucidchart, Miro, or other tools that work with the official AWS icons.
